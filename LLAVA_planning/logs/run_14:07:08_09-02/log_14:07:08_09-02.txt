[2026-02-09 14:07:09] ================================================================================
[2026-02-09 14:07:09] You are assisting a mobile robot navigating in a 2D plane to reach a goal while avoiding obstacles and deadlock situations.

IMAGE DESCRIPTION (also depicted visually):
- Green dot: agent at (np.float64(3.0), np.float64(4.0))
- Blue star: goal at (11.0, 4.0)
- Red dots: obstacle points detected by LIDAR
- Yellow dots: previous detour waypoints (areas already explored - AVOID THESE!)

TEXT DATA (authoritative):
- Agent position: (np.float64(3.0), np.float64(4.0))
- Goal position: (11.0, 4.0)
- LIDAR hit points: [(np.float64(3.0), np.float64(5.0)), (np.float64(3.0), np.float64(3.0))]
- Previous waypoint count: 0




SPATIAL SITUATION ANALYSIS:
- Obstacles detected: ABOVE=1, BELOW=1, LEFT=0, RIGHT=0
- Environment type: OPEN SPACE - multiple paths possible
- Goal direction: RIGHT and DOWN
- Goal is at: (11.0, 4.0), you are at: (np.float64(3.0), np.float64(4.0))
- Distance to goal: 8.00 units






TASK:
Return a SMALL SET of LOCAL DETOUR WAYPOINTS to move the agent past the obstacle.
These waypoints should help the agent make progress toward the goal.

RULES (MANDATORY):
1. Return ONLY JSON with key "waypoints"
2. Waypoints must be LOCAL (within 3 units of agent, no direct jump to goal)
3. Give exactly 4 waypoints
4. Keep waypoints AT LEAST 1.2 units away from red obstacle points (safety margin for path clearance between waypoints)
5. Keep waypoints AT LEAST 1.0 units away from yellow previous waypoints (critically important!)
6. Do NOT place waypoints in forbidden zones listed above
7. Move tangentially around obstacles, not directly into them
8. After clearing the obstacle, gradually turn toward the goal
9. Coordinates must be numeric [x, y] within bounds [0, 15]
10. Think about the spatial situation:
    - If in a NARROW CORRIDOR/TUNNEL: Place waypoints in the CENTER (midpoint between walls), NOT near the walls
    - If obstacles are on both sides (left+right or top+bottom): You're in a corridor - stay centered!
    - If in open space: Go around obstacles with safety margin

⚠️ CORRIDOR/TUNNEL RULE: If you see obstacles on BOTH sides of the agent, calculate the midpoint between them and place waypoints there!
Example: If obstacles at y=0.3 and y=1.0, place waypoints at y=0.65 (the center), NOT at y=0.5 or y=0.8 (too close to walls).



OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON only, no explanation):
{
  "waypoints": [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]
}

[2026-02-09 14:07:18] You are assisting a mobile robot navigating in a 2D plane to reach a goal while avoiding obstacles and deadlock situations.

IMAGE DESCRIPTION (also depicted visually):
- Green dot: agent at (np.float64(5.023754999999996), np.float64(4.0))
- Blue star: goal at (11.0, 4.0)
- Red dots: obstacle points detected by LIDAR
- Yellow dots: previous detour waypoints (areas already explored - AVOID THESE!)

TEXT DATA (authoritative):
- Agent position: (np.float64(5.023754999999996), np.float64(4.0))
- Goal position: (11.0, 4.0)
- LIDAR hit points: [(np.float64(6.0), np.float64(4.0)), (np.float64(6.0), np.float64(4.172138333281736)), (np.float64(6.0), np.float64(3.8278616667182637))]
- Previous waypoint count: 2




SPATIAL SITUATION ANALYSIS:
- Obstacles detected: ABOVE=1, BELOW=1, LEFT=0, RIGHT=3
- Environment type: OPEN SPACE - multiple paths possible
- Goal direction: RIGHT and DOWN
- Goal is at: (11.0, 4.0), you are at: (np.float64(5.023754999999996), np.float64(4.0))
- Distance to goal: 5.98 units





⚠️ CRITICAL: RECENT WAYPOINTS TO AVOID (most recent 2):
[array([4.2, 4. ]), array([5.4, 4. ])]

MANDATORY RULE: DO NOT place waypoints within 1.5 units of these locations!
If you place a waypoint near these coordinates, the agent will OSCILLATE ENDLESSLY!
Example: If recent waypoint is at [5.5, 4.5], do NOT place waypoint at [5.5, 3.0] or [6.0, 4.5].
You MUST choose COMPLETELY DIFFERENT coordinates at least 1.5 units away.


TASK:
Return a SMALL SET of LOCAL DETOUR WAYPOINTS to move the agent past the obstacle.
These waypoints should help the agent make progress toward the goal.

RULES (MANDATORY):
1. Return ONLY JSON with key "waypoints"
2. Waypoints must be LOCAL (within 3 units of agent, no direct jump to goal)
3. Give exactly 4 waypoints
4. Keep waypoints AT LEAST 1.2 units away from red obstacle points (safety margin for path clearance between waypoints)
5. Keep waypoints AT LEAST 1.0 units away from yellow previous waypoints (critically important!)
6. Do NOT place waypoints in forbidden zones listed above
7. Move tangentially around obstacles, not directly into them
8. After clearing the obstacle, gradually turn toward the goal
9. Coordinates must be numeric [x, y] within bounds [0, 15]
10. Think about the spatial situation:
    - If in a NARROW CORRIDOR/TUNNEL: Place waypoints in the CENTER (midpoint between walls), NOT near the walls
    - If obstacles are on both sides (left+right or top+bottom): You're in a corridor - stay centered!
    - If in open space: Go around obstacles with safety margin

⚠️ CORRIDOR/TUNNEL RULE: If you see obstacles on BOTH sides of the agent, calculate the midpoint between them and place waypoints there!
Example: If obstacles at y=0.3 and y=1.0, place waypoints at y=0.65 (the center), NOT at y=0.5 or y=0.8 (too close to walls).

RETRY FEEDBACK: The following waypoint sets were INVALID and caused collision or deadlock:

DO NOT repeat or closely approximate these points. Choose a clearly different direction and a different side of the obstacle.

[2026-02-09 14:07:38] ================================================================================
[2026-02-09 14:07:38] You are assisting a mobile robot navigating in a 2D plane to reach a goal while avoiding obstacles and deadlock situations.

IMAGE DESCRIPTION (also depicted visually):
- Green dot: agent at (np.float64(8.117967817827216), np.float64(4.567640229573415))
- Blue star: goal at (11.0, 4.0)
- Red dots: obstacle points detected by LIDAR
- Yellow dots: previous detour waypoints (areas already explored - AVOID THESE!)

TEXT DATA (authoritative):
- Agent position: (np.float64(8.117967817827216), np.float64(4.567640229573415))
- Goal position: (11.0, 4.0)
- LIDAR hit points: [(np.float64(9.0), np.float64(4.567640229573415)), (np.float64(9.0), np.float64(4.723166301143641)), (np.float64(9.0), np.float64(4.888673689549173)), (np.float64(9.0), np.float64(4.246606769597657)), (np.float64(9.0), np.float64(4.41211415800319))]
- Previous waypoint count: 6




SPATIAL SITUATION ANALYSIS:
- Obstacles detected: ABOVE=2, BELOW=2, LEFT=0, RIGHT=5
- Environment type: OPEN SPACE - multiple paths possible
- Goal direction: RIGHT and DOWN
- Goal is at: (11.0, 4.0), you are at: (np.float64(8.117967817827216), np.float64(4.567640229573415))
- Distance to goal: 2.94 units





⚠️ CRITICAL: RECENT WAYPOINTS TO AVOID (most recent 6):
[array([4.2, 4. ]), array([5.4, 4. ]), array([5.5, 5.5]), array([6.5, 5.5]), array([7.5, 5. ]), array([8.5, 4.5])]

MANDATORY RULE: DO NOT place waypoints within 1.5 units of these locations!
If you place a waypoint near these coordinates, the agent will OSCILLATE ENDLESSLY!
Example: If recent waypoint is at [5.5, 4.5], do NOT place waypoint at [5.5, 3.0] or [6.0, 4.5].
You MUST choose COMPLETELY DIFFERENT coordinates at least 1.5 units away.


TASK:
Return a SMALL SET of LOCAL DETOUR WAYPOINTS to move the agent past the obstacle.
These waypoints should help the agent make progress toward the goal.

RULES (MANDATORY):
1. Return ONLY JSON with key "waypoints"
2. Waypoints must be LOCAL (within 3 units of agent, no direct jump to goal)
3. Give exactly 4 waypoints
4. Keep waypoints AT LEAST 1.2 units away from red obstacle points (safety margin for path clearance between waypoints)
5. Keep waypoints AT LEAST 1.0 units away from yellow previous waypoints (critically important!)
6. Do NOT place waypoints in forbidden zones listed above
7. Move tangentially around obstacles, not directly into them
8. After clearing the obstacle, gradually turn toward the goal
9. Coordinates must be numeric [x, y] within bounds [0, 15]
10. Think about the spatial situation:
    - If in a NARROW CORRIDOR/TUNNEL: Place waypoints in the CENTER (midpoint between walls), NOT near the walls
    - If obstacles are on both sides (left+right or top+bottom): You're in a corridor - stay centered!
    - If in open space: Go around obstacles with safety margin

⚠️ CORRIDOR/TUNNEL RULE: If you see obstacles on BOTH sides of the agent, calculate the midpoint between them and place waypoints there!
Example: If obstacles at y=0.3 and y=1.0, place waypoints at y=0.65 (the center), NOT at y=0.5 or y=0.8 (too close to walls).

RETRY FEEDBACK: The following waypoint sets were INVALID and caused collision or deadlock:
[[(6.5, 3.0), (7.5, 3.5), (8.5, 4.0), (9.5, 4.0)]]

DO NOT repeat or closely approximate these points. Choose a clearly different direction and a different side of the obstacle.

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON only, no explanation):
{
  "waypoints": [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]
}

[2026-02-09 14:07:50] You are assisting a mobile robot navigating in a 2D plane to reach a goal while avoiding obstacles and deadlock situations.

IMAGE DESCRIPTION (also depicted visually):
- Green dot: agent at (np.float64(10.128596087866631), np.float64(5.54992153366271))
- Blue star: goal at (11.0, 4.0)
- Red dots: obstacle points detected by LIDAR
- Yellow dots: previous detour waypoints (areas already explored - AVOID THESE!)

TEXT DATA (authoritative):
- Agent position: (np.float64(10.128596087866631), np.float64(5.54992153366271))
- Goal position: (11.0, 4.0)
- LIDAR hit points: [(np.float64(9.473225124479178), np.float64(5.0)), (np.float64(9.667157131793807), np.float64(5.0)), (np.float64(9.811098742373293), np.float64(5.0)), (np.float64(9.928441018431386), np.float64(5.0)), (np.float64(10.031630084209317), np.float64(5.0)), (np.float64(10.128596087866631), np.float64(5.0)), (np.float64(10.225562091523946), np.float64(5.0)), (np.float64(10.328751157301877), np.float64(5.0)), (np.float64(10.44609343335997), np.float64(5.0)), (np.float64(10.590035043939455), np.float64(5.0)), (np.float64(10.783967051254082), np.float64(5.0))]
- Previous waypoint count: 9




SPATIAL SITUATION ANALYSIS:
- Obstacles detected: ABOVE=0, BELOW=11, LEFT=5, RIGHT=5
- Environment type: CORRIDOR - limited maneuvering space
- Goal direction: RIGHT and DOWN
- Goal is at: (11.0, 4.0), you are at: (np.float64(10.128596087866631), np.float64(5.54992153366271))
- Distance to goal: 1.78 units





⚠️ CRITICAL: RECENT WAYPOINTS TO AVOID (most recent 9):
[array([4.2, 4. ]), array([5.4, 4. ]), array([5.5, 5.5]), array([6.5, 5.5]), array([7.5, 5. ]), array([8.5, 4.5]), array([8.5, 6. ]), array([9.5, 6. ]), array([10.5,  5.5])]

MANDATORY RULE: DO NOT place waypoints within 1.5 units of these locations!
If you place a waypoint near these coordinates, the agent will OSCILLATE ENDLESSLY!
Example: If recent waypoint is at [5.5, 4.5], do NOT place waypoint at [5.5, 3.0] or [6.0, 4.5].
You MUST choose COMPLETELY DIFFERENT coordinates at least 1.5 units away.


TASK:
Return a SMALL SET of LOCAL DETOUR WAYPOINTS to move the agent past the obstacle.
These waypoints should help the agent make progress toward the goal.

RULES (MANDATORY):
1. Return ONLY JSON with key "waypoints"
2. Waypoints must be LOCAL (within 3 units of agent, no direct jump to goal)
3. Give exactly 4 waypoints
4. Keep waypoints AT LEAST 1.2 units away from red obstacle points (safety margin for path clearance between waypoints)
5. Keep waypoints AT LEAST 1.0 units away from yellow previous waypoints (critically important!)
6. Do NOT place waypoints in forbidden zones listed above
7. Move tangentially around obstacles, not directly into them
8. After clearing the obstacle, gradually turn toward the goal
9. Coordinates must be numeric [x, y] within bounds [0, 15]
10. Think about the spatial situation:
    - If in a NARROW CORRIDOR/TUNNEL: Place waypoints in the CENTER (midpoint between walls), NOT near the walls
    - If obstacles are on both sides (left+right or top+bottom): You're in a corridor - stay centered!
    - If in open space: Go around obstacles with safety margin

⚠️ CORRIDOR/TUNNEL RULE: If you see obstacles on BOTH sides of the agent, calculate the midpoint between them and place waypoints there!
Example: If obstacles at y=0.3 and y=1.0, place waypoints at y=0.65 (the center), NOT at y=0.5 or y=0.8 (too close to walls).

RETRY FEEDBACK: The following waypoint sets were INVALID and caused collision or deadlock:
[[(6.5, 3.0), (7.5, 3.5), (8.5, 4.0), (9.5, 4.0)]]

DO NOT repeat or closely approximate these points. Choose a clearly different direction and a different side of the obstacle.

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON only, no explanation):
{
  "waypoints": [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]
}

[2026-02-09 14:07:58] You are assisting a mobile robot navigating in a 2D plane to reach a goal while avoiding obstacles and deadlock situations.

IMAGE DESCRIPTION (also depicted visually):
- Green dot: agent at (np.float64(11.13153469785165), np.float64(5.637101589380396))
- Blue star: goal at (11.0, 4.0)
- Red dots: obstacle points detected by LIDAR
- Yellow dots: previous detour waypoints (areas already explored - AVOID THESE!)

TEXT DATA (authoritative):
- Agent position: (np.float64(11.13153469785165), np.float64(5.637101589380396))
- Goal position: (11.0, 4.0)
- LIDAR hit points: [(np.float64(10.372266589860082), np.float64(5.0)), (np.float64(10.5969429891801), np.float64(5.0)), (np.float64(10.76370392372174), np.float64(5.0)), (np.float64(10.899648683113497), np.float64(5.0)), (np.float64(11.019196498191642), np.float64(5.0)), (np.float64(11.13153469785165), np.float64(5.0)), (np.float64(11.24387289751166), np.float64(5.0)), (np.float64(11.363420712589802), np.float64(5.0)), (np.float64(11.49936547198156), np.float64(5.0)), (np.float64(11.666126406523201), np.float64(5.0)), (np.float64(11.890802805843217), np.float64(5.0))]
- Previous waypoint count: 11




SPATIAL SITUATION ANALYSIS:
- Obstacles detected: ABOVE=0, BELOW=11, LEFT=5, RIGHT=5
- Environment type: CORRIDOR - limited maneuvering space
- Goal direction: LEFT and DOWN
- Goal is at: (11.0, 4.0), you are at: (np.float64(11.13153469785165), np.float64(5.637101589380396))
- Distance to goal: 1.64 units





⚠️ CRITICAL: RECENT WAYPOINTS TO AVOID (most recent 10):
[array([5.4, 4. ]), array([5.5, 5.5]), array([6.5, 5.5]), array([7.5, 5. ]), array([8.5, 4.5]), array([8.5, 6. ]), array([9.5, 6. ]), array([10.5,  5.5]), array([10.5,  6.5]), array([11.5,  5.5])]

MANDATORY RULE: DO NOT place waypoints within 1.5 units of these locations!
If you place a waypoint near these coordinates, the agent will OSCILLATE ENDLESSLY!
Example: If recent waypoint is at [5.5, 4.5], do NOT place waypoint at [5.5, 3.0] or [6.0, 4.5].
You MUST choose COMPLETELY DIFFERENT coordinates at least 1.5 units away.


TASK:
Return a SMALL SET of LOCAL DETOUR WAYPOINTS to move the agent past the obstacle.
These waypoints should help the agent make progress toward the goal.

RULES (MANDATORY):
1. Return ONLY JSON with key "waypoints"
2. Waypoints must be LOCAL (within 3 units of agent, no direct jump to goal)
3. Give exactly 4 waypoints
4. Keep waypoints AT LEAST 1.2 units away from red obstacle points (safety margin for path clearance between waypoints)
5. Keep waypoints AT LEAST 1.0 units away from yellow previous waypoints (critically important!)
6. Do NOT place waypoints in forbidden zones listed above
7. Move tangentially around obstacles, not directly into them
8. After clearing the obstacle, gradually turn toward the goal
9. Coordinates must be numeric [x, y] within bounds [0, 15]
10. Think about the spatial situation:
    - If in a NARROW CORRIDOR/TUNNEL: Place waypoints in the CENTER (midpoint between walls), NOT near the walls
    - If obstacles are on both sides (left+right or top+bottom): You're in a corridor - stay centered!
    - If in open space: Go around obstacles with safety margin

⚠️ CORRIDOR/TUNNEL RULE: If you see obstacles on BOTH sides of the agent, calculate the midpoint between them and place waypoints there!
Example: If obstacles at y=0.3 and y=1.0, place waypoints at y=0.65 (the center), NOT at y=0.5 or y=0.8 (too close to walls).

RETRY FEEDBACK: The following waypoint sets were INVALID and caused collision or deadlock:
[[(6.5, 3.0), (7.5, 3.5), (8.5, 4.0), (9.5, 4.0)]]

DO NOT repeat or closely approximate these points. Choose a clearly different direction and a different side of the obstacle.

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON only, no explanation):
{
  "waypoints": [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]
}

⚠️ CRITICAL: RECENT WAYPOINTS TO AVOID (most recent 10):
[array([5.5, 5.5]), array([6.5, 5.5]), array([7.5, 5. ]), array([8.5, 4.5]), array([8.5, 6. ]), array([9.5, 6. ]), array([10.5,  5.5]), array([10.5,  6.5]), array([11.5,  5.5]), array([11.5,  6.5])]

MANDATORY RULE: DO NOT place waypoints within 1.5 units of these locations!
If you place a waypoint near these coordinates, the agent will OSCILLATE ENDLESSLY!
Example: If recent waypoint is at [5.5, 4.5], do NOT place waypoint at [5.5, 3.0] or [6.0, 4.5].
You MUST choose COMPLETELY DIFFERENT coordinates at least 1.5 units away.


TASK:
Return a SMALL SET of LOCAL DETOUR WAYPOINTS to move the agent past the obstacle.
These waypoints should help the agent make progress toward the goal.

RULES (MANDATORY):
1. Return ONLY JSON with key "waypoints"
2. Waypoints must be LOCAL (within 3 units of agent, no direct jump to goal)
3. Give exactly 4 waypoints
4. Keep waypoints AT LEAST 1.2 units away from red obstacle points (safety margin for path clearance between waypoints)
5. Keep waypoints AT LEAST 1.0 units away from yellow previous waypoints (critically important!)
6. Do NOT place waypoints in forbidden zones listed above
7. Move tangentially around obstacles, not directly into them
8. After clearing the obstacle, gradually turn toward the goal
9. Coordinates must be numeric [x, y] within bounds [0, 15]
10. Think about the spatial situation:
    - If in a NARROW CORRIDOR/TUNNEL: Place waypoints in the CENTER (midpoint between walls), NOT near the walls
    - If obstacles are on both sides (left+right or top+bottom): You're in a corridor - stay centered!
    - If in open space: Go around obstacles with safety margin

⚠️ CORRIDOR/TUNNEL RULE: If you see obstacles on BOTH sides of the agent, calculate the midpoint between them and place waypoints there!
Example: If obstacles at y=0.3 and y=1.0, place waypoints at y=0.65 (the center), NOT at y=0.5 or y=0.8 (too close to walls).

RETRY FEEDBACK: The following waypoint sets were INVALID and caused collision or deadlock:
[[(6.5, 3.0), (7.5, 3.5), (8.5, 4.0), (9.5, 4.0)]]

DO NOT repeat or closely approximate these points. Choose a clearly different direction and a different side of the obstacle.

⚠️ CRITICAL: RECENT WAYPOINTS TO AVOID (most recent 10):
[array([5.5, 5.5]), array([6.5, 5.5]), array([7.5, 5. ]), array([8.5, 4.5]), array([8.5, 6. ]), array([9.5, 6. ]), array([10.5,  5.5]), array([10.5,  6.5]), array([11.5,  5.5]), array([11.5,  6.5])]

MANDATORY RULE: DO NOT place waypoints within 1.5 units of these locations!
If you place a waypoint near these coordinates, the agent will OSCILLATE ENDLESSLY!
Example: If recent waypoint is at [5.5, 4.5], do NOT place waypoint at [5.5, 3.0] or [6.0, 4.5].
You MUST choose COMPLETELY DIFFERENT coordinates at least 1.5 units away.


TASK:
Return a SMALL SET of LOCAL DETOUR WAYPOINTS to move the agent past the obstacle.
These waypoints should help the agent make progress toward the goal.

RULES (MANDATORY):
1. Return ONLY JSON with key "waypoints"
2. Waypoints must be LOCAL (within 3 units of agent, no direct jump to goal)
3. Give exactly 4 waypoints
4. Keep waypoints AT LEAST 1.2 units away from red obstacle points (safety margin for path clearance between waypoints)
5. Keep waypoints AT LEAST 1.0 units away from yellow previous waypoints (critically important!)
6. Do NOT place waypoints in forbidden zones listed above
7. Move tangentially around obstacles, not directly into them
8. After clearing the obstacle, gradually turn toward the goal
9. Coordinates must be numeric [x, y] within bounds [0, 15]
10. Think about the spatial situation:
    - If in a NARROW CORRIDOR/TUNNEL: Place waypoints in the CENTER (midpoint between walls), NOT near the walls
    - If obstacles are on both sides (left+right or top+bottom): You're in a corridor - stay centered!
    - If in open space: Go around obstacles with safety margin

⚠️ CORRIDOR/TUNNEL RULE: If you see obstacles on BOTH sides of the agent, calculate the midpoint between them and place waypoints there!
Example: If obstacles at y=0.3 and y=1.0, place waypoints at y=0.65 (the center), NOT at y=0.5 or y=0.8 (too close to walls).

RETRY FEEDBACK: The following waypoint sets were INVALID and caused collision or deadlock:
[[(6.5, 3.0), (7.5, 3.5), (8.5, 4.0), (9.5, 4.0)], [(11.5, 4.5), (11.0, 4.0)], [(10.0, 4.5), (11.0, 4.0)], [(11.0, 4.5)]]

DO NOT repeat or closely approximate these points. Choose a clearly different direction and a different side of the obstacle.
