Prompt:
You are an AI assistant solving a 2D path planning task on a grid of size (10, 10).
The agent starts at position [1, 1] and must reach the goal at [9, 5].
Obstacles are defined as (x, y, width, height): [(3, 3, 0.5, 1), (6, 1, 2, 1), (2, 5, 3, 0.5), (7, 2, 1, 2)].

Path Planning Rules:
1. Each waypoint's x-coordinate must NOT fall in: x in (3, 3.5) or x in (6, 8) or x in (2, 5) or x in (7, 8)
2. Each waypoint's y-coordinate must NOT fall in: y in (3, 4) or y in (1, 2) or y in (5, 5.5) or y in (2, 4)
3. No straight line connecting the waypoints (including start -> first waypoint and last waypoint -> goal) may intersect any obstacle.
4. Each waypoint must be at least 0.5 units away from the boundary of any obstacle.
5. The Euclidean distance between any two adjacent waypoints (or start/goal) must NOT exceed 0.5 units.

Your task:
Return a list of more than 8 intermediate waypoints (excluding the start and goal).

=== Attempt 15 ===
**********************************************************************************************************************************
Prompt:
You are an AI assistant solving a 2D path planning task on a grid of size (10, 10).
The agent starts at position [1, 1] and must reach the goal at [9, 5].
Obstacles are defined as (x, y, width, height): [(3, 3, 0.5, 1), (6, 1, 2, 1), (2, 5, 3, 0.5), (7, 2, 1, 2)].

Path Planning Rules:
1. Each waypoint's x-coordinate must NOT fall in: x in (3, 3.5) or x in (6, 8) or x in (2, 5) or x in (7, 8)
2. Each waypoint's y-coordinate must NOT fall in: y in (3, 4) or y in (1, 2) or y in (5, 5.5) or y in (2, 4)
3. No straight line connecting the waypoints (including start -> first waypoint and last waypoint -> goal) may intersect any obstacle.
4. Each waypoint must be at least 0.5 units away from the boundary of any obstacle.
5. The Euclidean distance between any two adjacent waypoints (or start/goal) must NOT exceed 0.5 units.

Your task:
Return a list of more than 8 intermediate waypoints (excluding the start and goal).
Output strictly in this format:

**********************************************************************************************************************************

=== Attempt 29 ===
**********************************************************************************************************************************
Prompt:
You are an AI assistant solving a 2D path planning task on a grid of size (10, 10).
The agent starts at position [1, 1] and must reach the goal at [9, 5].
Obstacles are defined as (x, y, width, height): [(3, 3, 0.5, 1), (6, 1, 2, 1), (2, 5, 3, 0.5), (7, 2, 1, 2)].

Path Planning Rules:
1. Each waypoint's x-coordinate must NOT fall in: x in (3, 3.5) or x in (6, 8) or x in (2, 5) or x in (7, 8)
2. Each waypoint's y-coordinate must NOT fall in: y in (3, 4) or y in (1, 2) or y in (5, 5.5) or y in (2, 4)
3. No straight line connecting the waypoints (including start -> first waypoint and last waypoint -> goal) may intersect any obstacle.
4. Each waypoint must be at least 0.5 units away from the boundary of any obstacle.
5. The Euclidean distance between any two adjacent waypoints (or start/goal) must NOT exceed 0.5 units.

Your task:
Return a list of more than 8 intermediate waypoints (excluding the start and goal).
Output strictly in this format:
###OUTPUT_START###
[[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], ...]
###OUTPUT_END###

Do NOT include explanations, code, or anything outside the delimiters.
