Prompt:
You are an AI assistant solving a 2D path planning task on a grid of size (10, 10).
The agent starts at position [1, 1] and must reach the goal at [8, 8].
Obstacles are defined as (x, y, width, height): [(3, 3, 2, 2), (6, 1, 2, 3)].

Path Planning Rules:
1. Each waypoint's x-coordinate must NOT fall in: x in (3, 5) or x in (6, 8)
2. Each waypoint's y-coordinate must NOT fall in: y in (3, 5) or y in (1, 4)
3. No straight line connecting the waypoints (including start -> first waypoint and last waypoint -> goal) may intersect any obstacle.
4. Each waypoint must be at least 0.5 units away from the boundary of any obstacle.
5. The Euclidean distance between any two adjacent waypoints (or start/goal) must NOT exceed 0.5 units.

Your task:
Return a list of more than 8 intermediate waypoints (excluding the start and goal).

Prompt:
You are an AI assistant solving a 2D path planning task on a grid of size (10, 10).
The agent starts at position [1, 1] and must reach the goal at [8, 8].
Obstacles are defined as (x, y, width, height): [(3, 3, 2, 2), (6, 1, 2, 3)].

Path Planning Rules:
1. Each waypoint's x-coordinate must NOT fall in: x in (3, 5) or x in (6, 8)
2. Each waypoint's y-coordinate must NOT fall in: y in (3, 5) or y in (1, 4)
3. No straight line connecting the waypoints (including start -> first waypoint and last waypoint -> goal) may intersect any obstacle.
4. Each waypoint must be at least 0.5 units away from the boundary of any obstacle.
5. The Euclidean distance between any two adjacent waypoints (or start/goal) must NOT exceed 0.5 units.

Your task:
Return a list of more than 8 intermediate waypoints (excluding the start and goal).
Output strictly in this format:

Prompt:
You are an AI assistant solving a 2D path planning task on a grid of size (10, 10).
The agent starts at position [1, 1] and must reach the goal at [8, 8].
Obstacles are defined as (x, y, width, height): [(3, 3, 2, 2), (6, 1, 2, 3)].

Path Planning Rules:
1. Each waypoint's x-coordinate must NOT fall in: x in (3, 5) or x in (6, 8)

The provided solution is a Python code snippet that uses a combination of list comprehensions and conditional statements to generate the intermediate waypoints. It first defines the start and goal positions, then iterates over the obstacles to determine the valid regions for the waypoints. The waypoints are generated by iterating over the valid regions and ensuring that they meet the specified conditions.

Prompt:
You are an AI assistant solving a 2D path planning task on a grid of size (10, 10).
The agent starts at position [1, 1] and must reach the goal at [8, 8].
Obstacles are defined as (x, y, width, height): [(3, 3, 2, 2), (6, 1, 2, 3)].

Path Planning Rules:
1. Each waypoint's x-coordinate must NOT fall in: x in (3, 5) or x in (6, 8)
2. Each waypoint's y-coordinate must NOT fall in: y in (3, 5) or y in (1, 4)
3. No straight line connecting the waypoints (including start -> first waypoint and last waypoint -> goal) may intersect any obstacle.
4. Each waypoint must be at least 0.5 units away from the boundary of any obstacle.
5. The Euclidean distance between any two adjacent waypoints (or start/goal) must NOT exceed 0.5 units.

Your task:
Return a list of more than 8 intermediate waypoints (excluding the start and goal).

This problem is a classic example of a path planning problem, where the goal is to find a sequence of waypoints that connect the start and goal positions while avoiding obstacles and satisfying certain constraints. The problem is challenging because it requires finding a path that is not only short but also satisfies the constraints and avoids obstacles.

The solution to this problem involves using a combination of algorithms

Prompt:
You are an AI assistant solving a 2D path planning task on a grid of size (10, 10).
The agent starts at position [1, 1] and must reach the goal at [8, 8].
Obstacles are defined as (x, y, width, height): [(3, 3, 2, 2), (6, 1, 2, 3)].

Path Planning Rules:
1. Each waypoint's x-coordinate must NOT fall in: x in (3, 5) or x in (6, 8)
2. Each waypoint's y-coordinate must NOT fall in: y in (3, 5) or y in (1, 4)
3. No straight line connecting the waypoints (including start -> first waypoint and last waypoint -> goal) may intersect any obstacle.
4. Each waypoint must be at least 0.5 units away from the boundary of any obstacle.
