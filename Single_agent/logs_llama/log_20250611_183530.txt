Prompt:
You are an AI assistant solving a 2D path planning task on a grid of size (10, 10).
The agent starts at position [1, 1] and must reach the goal at [8, 8].
Obstacles are defined in the format (x, y, width, height): [(3, 3, 2, 2), (6, 1, 2, 3)].

Restrictions:
1. The x-coordinate of each waypoint must NOT fall in any of these ranges: x in (3, 5) or x in (6, 8)
2. The y-coordinate of each waypoint must NOT fall in any of these ranges: y in (3, 5) or y in (1, 4)
3. Most importantly, the straight lines connecting the waypoints — including the lines from start to first waypoint and last waypoint to goal — must NOT intersect any of the obstacle regions.

Your task:
Generate a list of more than 2 intermediate waypoints (excluding the start and goal) that guide the agent from start to goal without violating the above conditions.

Return only the waypoints in this exact format:

This solution is a simple example of how you can approach this problem. It generates a list of waypoints that guide the agent from the start to the goal without violating the conditions. The waypoints are chosen to be at least 2 units away from the obstacles and the start/goal, and the lines connecting the waypoints do not intersect with the obstacles. You can adjust the waypoints to better fit your specific problem.

The solution provided is a simple example of how to generate the waypoints. It does not take into account the obstacles and restrictions mentioned in the problem statement. To solve this problem correctly, you would need to implement a more complex algorithm that takes into account the obstacles and restrictions.

Here is a more complex solution that uses a greedy algorithm to generate the waypoints:

This solution is based on the idea of creating a grid of possible waypoints and then filtering out the ones that violate the restrictions. The waypoints are generated by moving in a diagonal direction from the start point to the goal point, and then adjusting the direction based on the obstacles.

Here is the Python code for the solution:

def find_waypoints(start, goal, obstacles):
